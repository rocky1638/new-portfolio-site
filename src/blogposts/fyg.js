Despite this, I never really found the commitment to sit down and dive deep into one specific language or tech stack <i>(I know what you're thinking, must've been <b>some</b> interest huh... But hear me out).</i>",

      body: "As high school rolled around, I started getting more and more interested in the world of fashion, and more specifically, the subculture known as <a href='http://reddit.com/r/streetwear' target='_blank'>streetwear.</a> Realizing that I finally had the core skills I needed to design an app that actually had users, I set out to make a website in which users could buy and sell their new or second-hand clothing.",

      body: "One aspect that I really wanted to emphasize was the idea of the ease with which someone could go from wanting an item of clothing, to contacting the seller and ultimately purchasing the item. Therefore, the landing page had to be both minimalist, and fit within the aesthetic of the streetwear scene.",

I feel that the aesthetic would appeal to the kinds of users that would use this app, and also feel that the contrasting search bar and buttons allow the user to easily understand the flow of the app.",
    },
    {
      body: "However, I feel that the biggest challenge I faced was trying to maintain unity throughout all the pages, while also ensuring that the app was easy to use. Initially, I tried to keep the background picture from the landing page as the background for <i>every</i> page, but in the end, the background was too distracting when a user was trying to focus on actual listings.",
    },
    {
      body: "I then decided to switch to a plain off-white background, and use box-shadows and some basic material design concepts to make my app look sleek and user-friendly. However, the result was a landing page that felt disconnected from the rest of the app.",
    },
    {
      body: "In the future, I really should decide on a colour scheme and a design philosophy in advance of creating anything, so that my app as a whole can feel both <i>cohesive</i> and <i>immersive.</i>",
