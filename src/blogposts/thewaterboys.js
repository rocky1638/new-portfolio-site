    {
      body: "With this in mind, it should come as no surprise that entering the University of Waterloo as a first year student, I had heard of The Water Boys, and had seen many of their performances on YouTube. However, I would have never expected myself to audition for them, much less go to the semi-finals of an <b>international a capella competition</b> with them."

      body: "In my first term at school, a couple of friends of mine convinced me to join a capella club, and I ended up spending my term with ACE, the non-auditioned group. As the first term flew by, I found myself looking forward to the rehearsals, and by the end of the term, realized that I would miss the singing, the dancing, and most of all, the people."

    },
    {
      body: "The range check went surprisingly well, considering that I didn't know what to expect. I managed to sing a C5 as my highest upper note, and an E2 as my lowest note. <b>Pretty good!</b>"

      body: "Next, it was time to sing my songs. For my solo pieces, I decided to sing <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk9K032K7UM' target='_blank'>Talking To The Moon</a>, by Bruno Mars, and <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvgZkm1xWPE' target='_blank'>Viva La Vida</a>, by Coldplay. I felt like they both went pretty well, and I went away feeling pretty good about my chances of getting called back."
    },
    {
      body: "Lo and behold, that night, I got an email inviting me to callbacks the next day. Callbacks were essentially run like what a normal rehearsal would be, and long story short, I eventually got the email congratulating me on making it into the Water Boys!"

      body: "The day started with light practice in the morning, a break, and then soundcheck. As 7pm rolled around, it was time for the show to start. We watched the groups perfom, and waited for our turn. All the groups were really good, and to be completely honest, I did not expect to place in the top 2, which would have allowed us to go the semifinals in Buffalo, NY later that term. However, at the end of the night, all the groups got onto the stage, and to my dismay, <b>we placed second!</b>"

We were somewhere in the middle when it came to performance order, and after watching the previous groups perform, it was pretty clear to me that the quality of the groups here far surpassed the average quality at the quarterfinals. Either way, we performed, and I am sure that each and every one of us left our hearts and voices out there on the stage, delivering possibly our best performance yet.",
