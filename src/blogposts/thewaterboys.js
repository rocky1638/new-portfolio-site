      body: "With this in mind, it should come as no surprise that entering the University of Waterloo as a first year student, I had heard of The Water Boys, and had seen many of their performances on YouTube. However, I would have never expected myself to audition for them, much less go to the semi-finals of an <b>international a capella competition</b> with them."

As the first term flew by, I found myself looking forward to the rehearsals, and by the end of the term, realized that I would miss the singing, the dancing, and most of all, the people."

      body: "The range check went surprisingly well, considering that I didn't know what to expect. I managed to sing a C5 as my highest upper note, and an E2 as my lowest note. <b>Pretty good!</b>"

      body: "Next, it was time to sing my songs. For my solo pieces, I decided to sing <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk9K032K7UM' target='_blank'>Talking To The Moon</a>, by Bruno Mars, and <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvgZkm1xWPE' target='_blank'>Viva La Vida</a>, by Coldplay. I felt like they both went pretty well, and I went away feeling pretty good about my chances of getting called back."
