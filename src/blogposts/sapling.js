      body: "Just a couple of days after finishing working on <a href='https://rockzhou.com/blog/fyg' target='_blank'>FindYourGrail</a>, I was itching to start work on another project, so I could cement my newfound knowledge and skills, as well as redeem myself, in terms of creating a product that felt <i>user-friendly and cohesive.</i>",

      body: "Before I get into the specifics of the app, you might be wondering why I decided to build a practice tracking app. In fact, I'll preface the explanation by saying that by the time I was done with the app, I had one of those <i>'Why didn't I make/find this sooner!'</i> moments.",
    },
    {
      body: "You see, I've been practicing piano through the Royal Conservatory of Music (RCM) for over a decade, and in the last couple years, I started to lose a little bit of motivation, because as the repertoire got harder, the progress came slower. I found myself wanting something that could allow me to track my progress, struggles, and achievements easily. Of course, there were many apps that you <i>could</i> do this on, but nothing <i>(as far as I'm aware)</i> that was solely tailored for <b>practice.</b>",
    },
    {
      body: "To add to my motivations, I had just joined <a href='https://www.facebook.com/waterboysuw/' target='_blank'>The Water Boys</a>, an a capella group where I needed to practice bi-weekly. (More on that amazing experience <a href='https://rockzhou.com/blog/thewaterboys' target='_blank'>here.</a>) All in all, I felt that I could personally benefit from such an app, and had no doubt that others could too.",

    {
      body: "In general, the goal of the app was to have pages to allow users to create new categories of practice, and then to log practices, based on category. Simple enough.",
    },
    {
      body: "First time users would be met by a landing page that featured some brief value statements, as well as clear buttons that allowed the user to log in with either Google or Facebook.",

    },
    {
      body: "As far as for what I plan on doing next, I've recently started diving into mobile app development, and once I get comfortable with that, I might consider porting Sapling to mobile. This would probably be a better platform for the app, as the timer could run in the background, without the need for the user to keep their laptops open while practicing.",

    {
      body: "In terms of web development, I would still like to learn some more complicated concepts such as sockets for live chats. Finally, I want to get to the point where I can make a CSS file for a large app clean and efficient, without being overwhelmed by redundant or conflicting classes.",
