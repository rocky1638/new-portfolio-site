Although it did satisfy my limited needs as a beginning developer, I quickly began to notice that as my files got larger, Atom got <b>very</b> laggy."

    {
      body: "Eventually, I got tired of the lag and switched over to <a href='https://code.visualstudio.com/' target='_blank'>Visual Studio Code</a>, which for a while, was pretty great. It had a very active developer community creating extensions and ran significantly smoother for me than Atom did."

I had heard of Vim before, but never really looked into it, and so one day during work, I decided to take the plunge and try to learn Vim."

If you really want to learn vim, the first thing I would suggest is to type <code>vimtutor</code> into your terminal, and work through that tutorial, which takes about 20 minutes."
